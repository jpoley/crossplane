# Crossplane Examples

In this directory you will find example workloads demonstrating the usage of various resources supported by Crossplane for each of the supported clouds.  [Cloud provider credentials](../../docs/cloud-providers.md) will be needed before using any of these examples.

The cloud services column will link to an Example User Guide if one is available for that cloud.  A blank cloud column indicates that the example has not been adapted to that cloud yet.
